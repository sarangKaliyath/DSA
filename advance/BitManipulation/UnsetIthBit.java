package BitManipulation;

/*
Problem Description
You are given two integers A and B.
    If B-th bit in A is set, make it unset.
    If B-th bit in A is unset, leave as it is.
Return the updated A value.
Note:
The bit position is 0-indexed, which means that the least significant bit (LSB) has index 0.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 10^9
0 <= B <= 30

Input Format
First argument A is an integer.
Second argument B is an integer.

Output Format
Return an integer.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4
B = 1

Input 2:
A = 5
B = 2

Example Output
Output 1: 4
Output 2: 1

Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Given N = 4 which is 100 in binary. The 1-st bit is already unset

For Input 2:
Given N = 5 which is 101 in binary. We unset the 2-nd bit
It becomes 001 which is 1 in Decimal.
